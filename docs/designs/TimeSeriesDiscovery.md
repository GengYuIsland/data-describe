# Design Proposal for Sensor Discovery 

## Motivation

A better way to explore time series data especially with use cases like coorelations of analog/digital signals from sensors.

## Challenges

 * will a general UI work with these specific problems
 * can this work within the constraints of the user
 * will the jupyter UI alone be good enough

## Examples

 * with a click of the button I want to automatically find outlier discovery
 * 

## Potential Data Sets

Kaggle examples for manufacturing:

 * CNC milling maching
 * Earthquake
 * 
 
 

## Alternatives Considered
